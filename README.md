##  Architecture & Tech Stack

| Layer                    | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MVC Architecture**     | Follows a clean Model-View-Controller pattern:<br>‚Ä¢ **Model** handles data and schema logic<br>‚Ä¢ **Controller** processes HTTP requests<br>‚Ä¢ **Routes** map endpoints cleanly to controllers |
| **Express.js Backend**   | Built using Express.js for its minimal and scalable HTTP framework, supporting RESTful API design and middleware integration                               |
| **Rate Limiting**       | Secured with `express-rate-limit` middleware to prevent abuse, control traffic spikes, and ensure server reliability                                        |
| **Connection Pooling**   | MySQL database connections optimized using `mysql2` pooling to reduce overhead and manage concurrent queries efficiently                                     |
| **Cloud Deployment**     | Deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app) ‚Äî a cloud-native deployment platform supporting CI/CD, environmental configs, and secure database hosting        |
| **Postman Documentation**| A well-structured Postman collection is provided with example requests, responses, and endpoint categories. Public docs are accessible for external devs     |
